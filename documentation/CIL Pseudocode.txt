Class CarInterpreter
    Property carScriptCode As String

    Method interpretCarScript(code)
        lines = Split code into lines
        For each line in lines
            Clean line of whitespace
            If line is "END" Then Exit For
            tokens = Split line into tokens
            For each token in tokens
                Determine action based on token:
                    "drive();" -> Call CarControls.drive()
                    "stop();" -> Call CarControls.stop()
                    "reverse();" -> Call CarControls.reverse()
                    "horn();" -> Call CarControls.horn()
                    "read_sensor();" -> Print Sensor.readSensor()
                    "if" -> Execute block if condition is True
                    "else" -> Execute block
                    "while" -> Execute block while condition is True
                    Handle arithmetic and comparison operations
